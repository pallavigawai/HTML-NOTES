HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language):-
It provides a description of the structure/layout of your web page. We define this structure by wrapping content in HTML elements.
The component used to design the structure of websites are called Element tags.
The first line, <!DOCTYPE html>, is referred as a doctype declaration. This is used to indicate to a browser what HTML version the file is written in. For this file, specifying html indicates that the file is written in HTML5.
We must place <head> and <body> elements within the root <html> element.
* The <head> element may also contain links to Javascript files and CSS stylesheets.
* The <body> element contains the main content of an HTML file. This is the element that holds the information that is rendered by your web browser.
